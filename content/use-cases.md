The “six” Use Case categories: from Matt and Carl’s slide summary 20160417
* Facilitate citation
* Enable credit, compliance, and quality
* Facilitate discovery and access
* Understand software functionality
* Enable interoperability
* Enable transparency and reproducibility




THE ‘ORIGINAL’ 13 CASES: 20160415
Then determine a final set of categorized use cases based on these 3 different sets


1. Identify software functionality
   * Overall
   * Module level
   * Function level
   * Identify functional equivalency with other {modules, functions, etc)
1. Understand dependencies
   * Identify Installation Dependencies (User)
   * Identify Development/Build Dependencies (Developer)
   * Use dependencies to enable transitive credit
   * Automate build processes
   * Identify dependencies to assign (aspects of? partial?) credit
   * Understand role of software in an application (even if we cannot access or install)
1. Facilitate Discovery
   * Support discovery for reuse
   * Discover agents that can perform a specific function
      * Enable comparisons of agent functionality
   * Classify and find agents by domain, and other controlled vocabularies
   * Locate agents that were used for particular applications/results
   * Discover location of software
1. Enable credit, compliance, and evaluation
   * Identify roles of software contributors
      * Authors
      * Metadata authors
      * Curators
      * Other roles (see publisher’s credit ontology)
   * Document compliance with funders policies
   * Identify funder of software
1. Citation
   * Cite software product generally
   * Cite a specific software version/release
   * Cite a software paper describing the software
   * Provide sufficient info for formal citation in the reference list (authors, title, repository, publication year)
   * Link to a landing page with more detailed information about the software
   * Link to the source code
1. Count the citations to a given version of software
   * For acknowledgement/credit
   * As a quality metric for discovery
* Aggregate by person, by infrastructure, etc.
1. Enable Interoperability
   * Describe platform, language constraints
   * Describe input-output formats
   * Describe input-output semantics
   * Enable pipeline building
   * Describe constraints on parameters
   * Identify license obligations
1. Describe provenance information
   * Execution parameters, limitations / assumptions
1. Enable transparency and reproducibility (via dependencies and source linkages)
2. Communicate permissions / License terms
3. Identify software status (See http://www.repostatus.org)
   * Build status
   * Maintenance status
   * Understand intention of software publication (compliance, reuse, etc.)
   * …
1. Motivate archiving of software
2. Evaluate software quality

Stakeholders: Digital Repositories, Publishers, Information Science, Indexers, Software Developers,


datacite/crossref/orcid -- utility providers


`Researcher'' includes both academic researchers (e.g., postdoc, tenure-track faculty member) and research software engineers. \item


``Publisher'' includes both traditional publishers that publish text and\slash or software papers as well as archives such as Zenodo that directly publish software. \item


``Funder'' is a group that funds software or work using software. \item


``Indexer'' examples include Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Microsoft Academic Search. \item `


`Domain group\slash library\slash archive'' includes the Astronomy Source Code Library (ASCL)~\cite{ascl}, bioCADDIE~\cite{bioCADDIE}, Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG)~\cite{CIG}, libraries, institutional archives, etc. \item


``Repository'' refers to public software repositories such as GitHub, Netlib, Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), and institutional repositories. \item `


``Citation manager`` refers to people and organizations that create scholarly reference management software and websites including Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote, RefWorks, BibDesk, etc., that manage citation information and semi-automatically insert those citations into research products.
