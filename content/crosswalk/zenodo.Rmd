[Zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org) is a data archive based at CERN which is popularly used to archive and provide DOIs to academic software from GitHub, as described in the official GitHub guide to [Making your code citable](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/).


```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, output="asis"}
library("tidyverse")
crosswalk <- "https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta/raw/master/crosswalk.csv"
cw <- read_csv(crosswalk)
cw %>% 
  select(Property, `Zenodo`) %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Zenodo`)) -> df

knitr::kable(df, "html", table.attr="class=\"table table-striped\"")
```
